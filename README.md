# ASL-recognition-Deep-Learning
American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary language used by many deaf individuals in North America, and it is also used by hard-of-hearing and hearing individuals. The language is as rich as spoken languages and employs signs made with the hand, along with facial gestures and bodily postures.

Here, I have trained a convolutional neural network to classify images of ASL letters. After loading, examining, and preprocessing the data, the CNN was trained and tested for performance.
